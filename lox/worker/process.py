.. module:: process
   :synopsis: Easily execute a function or method in multiple processes.

Still allows the decorated function/method as normal.

Example:

    .. doctest::
        :skipif: True

        >>> import lox
        >>> 
        >>> @lox.process(4) # Will operate with a maximum of 4 processes
        ... def foo(x,y):
        ...     return x*y
        >>> foo(3,4)
        12
        >>> for i in range(5):
        ...     foo.scatter(i, i+1)
        >>> # foo is currently being executed in 4 processes
        >>> results = foo.gather()
        >>> print(results)

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_workers : int
        Number of process workers to invoke. Defaults to number of CPU cores.

    Methods
    -------
    __call__( *args, **kwargs )
        Vanilla passthrough function execution. Default user function behavior.
        
        Returns
        -------
        Decorated function return type.
            Return of decorated function.

    __len__()
        Returns
        -------
        int
            job queue length.

    scatter( *args, **kwargs )
        Start a job executing ``func( *args, **kwargs )``.
        Workers are created and destroyed automatically.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Solution's index into the results obtained via ``gather()``.

    gather()
        Block until all jobs called via ``scatter()`` are complete.

        Returns
        -------
        list
            Results in the order that scatter was invoked.
